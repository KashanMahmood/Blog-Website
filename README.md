## What Worked Well
I think it works quite well. I would say sometimes it felt a little overwheling working with axios and the database but i think it was good. The CSS turned out well and i think the functionality is good too
## What Didn't
One thing that didnt work well was that when you go to click on a post to view in full screen, there is a split second where you see the previous post that was open. This is due to the database ooading. The TAs said to not to worry about it but it was still something that bothered me. 
Another thing that didn't work well was about the project as a whole. At first, and even now to a certain extent, I don't really 100% understand the state/redux stuff. I think more practice will help with that
